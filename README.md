This game was built during the "Hardware Weekend - Washington DC Edition" organized by hackster.io on 19 September 2015.

The game uses the Leap Motion to control the movement of a ball in a Unity environment. It can currently receive and log click events from a Pebble watch using the Pebble SDK. Working on integrating Pebble click events into the game.
