This game was built during the "Hackster Hardware Weekend - Washington DC Edition" organized by hackster.io on 19 September 2015. This game is still a work in progress.

The game is built in Unity. The gameplay is very basic with a player moving a ball through a terrain containing multiple obstacles. The movement of the ball is controlled by the player's hand movements using tracking data from the Leap Motion Device. 

The player can also make the ball jump in the game by clicking a button on the Pebble smart watch.
The code for logging click events from a Pebble watch can be found at this link https://github.com/dshah22/BallGame.
Instructions on how to run the code using the Pebble SDK are coming soon.
