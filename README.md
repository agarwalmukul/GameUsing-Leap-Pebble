The game was built during the "Hardware Weekend - Washington DC Edition" organized by hackster.io on 19 September 2015.

The game is built in Unity using Leap Motion to control elements within the game. We have also developed code to receive and log click events from a Pebble watch using the Pebble SDK. Currently working on integrating Pebble click events into the game.
