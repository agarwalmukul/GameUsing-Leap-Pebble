This game was built during the "Hackster Hardware Weekend - Washington DC Edition" organized by hackster.io on 19 September 2015. Take a look at this project on the hackster website at https://www.hackster.io/8686/game-for-pebble-using-leap-1b8a89.

The game is developed in Unity. In the game, the player has to move a ball through an enclosed terrain consisting of multiple obstacles. The movement of the ball is controlled by the player's hand movements using tracking data from the Leap Motion Device. 

The player can also interact with the ball by pressing buttons on the Pebble smart watch. For example the player can make the ball jump by pressing the “up” button on the Pebble watch.

The code for logging click events from a Pebble watch can be found at the following link:

1. Download this repository as a zip.

2. Extract the zip file to a folder "GameUsing-Leap-Pebble-master".

3. Go to /GameUsing-Leap-Pebble-master/Assests/_Scenes/.

4. Open BackupOne.unity.

5. Play the game.

Instructions on how to run the code for logging Pebble click events are coming soon.
